//(6) when you are outside of the head and outside of functions, you can use just two slashes to leave single-line comments like this and you don't need to close

//(7) just below here you see "var," declaring mymap as a variable, then setting your map parameters. You can redefine features of a variable in your code as needed.
//    you could actually name this anything, as long as you call it up the same way each time throughout the code

//(8) note that you might also see "const" used to identify variables in code, when you want a CONSTANT variable. Functionally, these will tend to work similarly in our work.
//(9) here you define the longitude, latitude, and zoom level of the user map when they load the page, then follow with the tile layer you want (here it is mapbox)
	
	
	var mymap = L.map('mapid').setView([40.819273, -96.702968], 16);
	// Below was the original map layer. I took it out because when you zoomed in and out the user could see it load.

	//	maxZoom: 19,
	//	attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors '
	//}).addTo(mymap);
//(10) right above here, you see you're adding this tileset and setting the max zoom level of "mymap" 

//(11) this is how you define individual features on the map - a marker, a cirlce, a polygon. You could also call up a variable and point it to a hosted GIS file to load it in.
//(12) note that each popup has preloaded text here. You could also have a variable that points attributes in a dataset to populate a popup; we will do this in the future
	L.marker([40.819273, -96.702968]).addTo(mymap)
		.bindPopup("<b>Hello world!</b><br />I open automatically.").openPopup();

	L.circle([40.8207, -96.7056], 150, {
		color: 'red',
		fillColor: '#D2B5B5',
		fillOpacity: 0.2
	}).addTo(mymap).bindPopup("This is Memorial Stadium!");
	//(13) notice that you can set the color of the outline by using major color names, as well as the FILL color with hex codes. With larger datasets, you'd spe


	L.polygon([
		[40.81801389, -96.70111111],

	]).addTo(mymap).bindPopup("This polygon shows the location of the Nebraska Union");
	//(14) three nodes - this is a triangle... you can add more nodes to the polygon by separating each with a comma, just make sure the last vertex terminates without a comma!!!


	var popup = L.popup();
	//(15) here you could set the attributes of the popup instead of setting each to specific text
	
	
	//(16)Love Library is formatted here like a geojson file. This is more likely how you would use vector data in your visualizations. Notice that it's Var LoveLibrary...
	//Somebody in class asked if that's common to throw it all in the file. Well, more often, you might want to add a file like lovelibrary.js and load it into your header,
	//and inside that file, you would have your var lovelibrary and all of this there. That would save your page from getting overly long, like this one.
	//That way you would just say L.geoJSON(LoveLibrary,{}).addTo(mymap); and it would work the same as having all these lines:
		var LoveLibrary = {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Love Library",
        "amenity": "Library",
        "popupContent": "This is a library!"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-96.702572, 40.817804]
    }
};

	L.geoJSON(LoveLibrary,{}).addTo(mymap).bindPopup("This is Love Library");
	
	
	L.tileLayer('https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager_labels_under/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png', {
	attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attributions">CARTO</a>',
	subdomains: 'abcd',
	maxZoom: 19 }
	)
	.addTo(mymap);
//(17)note there at the bottom that you "addTo(mymap)" - addTo is a Leaflet function that adds a layer, and in parenthesis you tell it to add it to the variable "mymap," which is where all of your code is written.
